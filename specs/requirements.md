## Phase 2: Enhanced Features

Features to build upon the core functionality for a richer user experience.

## Screen Layout Proposal

Two primary directions for the TUI layout are proposed.

### A. Single View
- A simple layout where the entire screen is dedicated to a single view (e.g., a timeline). The user switches between content (different timelines, notifications, post composition window) via keyboard shortcuts.
- **Pros:** Relatively simple to implement, clean and uncluttered view.
- **Cons:** Cannot view multiple information streams simultaneously.

### B. Multi-Column View (TweetDeck-style)
- The screen is divided into several columns, each displaying a different information stream (e.g., Home, Notifications, and Local timelines side-by-side).
- **Pros:** High information density, allowing users to monitor multiple streams at once.
- **Cons:** More complex to implement, can feel crowded on smaller terminal screens.

## Initial Recommendation

The recommended starting point is to implement the **Phase 1 (MVP)** features using a **Single View** layout. This provides a solid foundation to build upon.
